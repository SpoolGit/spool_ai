     5 Key Qualification Questions for Verity Interiors Ltd
    </h1>
    <p>
     Based on the prospect's profile as a specialist fit-out and refurbishment business in the construction industry, here are the 5 most relevant questions to qualify them for construction payment solutions:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      <strong>
       What is your current payment cycle with main contractors, and how does this impact your cash flow management?
      </strong>
      (This helps understand their payment pain points)
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       As a small business with 10 employees, what challenges do you face with delayed payments from clients, and how do you currently manage these delays?
      </strong>
      (Identifies specific cash flow challenges)
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Do you work with any of the major contractors in our network (like Morgan Sindall, Laing O'Rourke, Balfour Beatty, etc.), and if so, what has been your experience with their payment processes?
      </strong>
      (Determines compatibility with existing network)
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       What financial solutions are you currently using to manage cash flow between project milestones? Are you using factoring or other external financing?
      </strong>
      (Identifies current solutions and potential cost savings)
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       With your focus on both CAT A/B projects and day 2/churn work, how do payment terms differ between these project types, and which creates more cash flow pressure for your business?
      </strong>
      (Understands their specific business model and payment challenges)
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     These questions will help determine if Verity Interiors would benefit from Copay's early payment services while gathering specific information about their payment challenges as a small construction specialist.
    </p>

     Overcoming Objections to Early Payment Services
    </h1>
    <h2>
     For cost/fee concerns:
    </h2>
    <ol>
     <li>
      Unlike factoring companies which are "expensive and hard to stop using," Copay offers a more cost-effective solution with flexible terms.
     </li>
     <li>
      The dynamic discounting model is designed to be cheaper than traditional financing options - you only pay when you choose to use it.
     </li>
     <li>
      The potential cost is offset by improved cash flow stability, which helps avoid expensive emergency financing or late payment penalties.
     </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>
     For skepticism about needing another financial tool:
    </h2>
    <ol>
     <li>
      Copay isn't just another payment process - it's specifically designed for construction subcontractors to address industry-specific cash flow challenges.
     </li>
     <li>
      Unlike existing payment processes, Copay gives you control to "get paid on your terms" rather than waiting on delayed invoices.
     </li>
     <li>
      The free portal provides 24/7 access to payment and invoice data, giving you better visibility than traditional systems.
     </li>
     <li>
      As one customer noted, Copay "creates a win-win situation" between contractors and subcontractors, improving business relationships.
     </li>
