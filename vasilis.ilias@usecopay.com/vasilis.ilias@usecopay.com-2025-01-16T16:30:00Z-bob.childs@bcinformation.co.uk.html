   <div class="content" name="handling_objection">
    <h3>
     Based on the context and taking the role of a seller, here's how I would handle these objections:
    </h3>
    <h4>
     Objection 1: "We already have existing software/systems..."
    </h4>
    <h5>
     Response:
    </h5>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Copay is designed to complement existing systems, not replace them - it integrates with platforms like COINS
     </li>
     <li>
      Unlike traditional systems, Copay creates a win-win situation by incentivizing early payments through dynamic discounting
     </li>
     <li>
      You keep your current process but gain additional benefits of cost savings and improved supplier relationships
     </li>
     <li>
      The sign-up and integration process is simple and our dedicated support team assists through every step
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
     Objection 2: "Our company is too small..."
    </h4>
    <h5>
     Response:
    </h5>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Copay is flexible and scales to your needs - you only use it when you need cashflow
     </li>
     <li>
      There's no debt or external funding involved, making it cost-effective compared to traditional financing options like factoring
     </li>
     <li>
      Real testimonial from a £2M painting business shows smaller companies are benefiting from the platform
     </li>
     <li>
      The platform is free to access for 24/7 invoice and payment tracking, so you get value even with minimal usage
     </li>
     <li>
      You can accelerate payments on your terms, only when it makes financial sense for your business
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     These responses focus on flexibility, ease of integration, and cost-effectiveness while using real examples from the context to build credibility.
