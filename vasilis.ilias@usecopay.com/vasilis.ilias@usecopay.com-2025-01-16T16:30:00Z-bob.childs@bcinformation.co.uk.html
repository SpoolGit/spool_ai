    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      "Given your expertise in construction software, particularly in estimating and accounting solutions, how do you currently handle payment processes and cashflow management between contractors and subcontractors in your software solutions?"
     </li>
     <li>
      "Since you work with contractors and house builders, what are the main payment-related challenges your clients typically face that your current software solutions address or don't address?"
     </li>
     <li>
      "With your recent acquisition by OFA/Constructionline, are you looking to expand your service offerings to include payment and cashflow management solutions for your clients?"
     </li>
     <li>
      "In your 30+ years of construction software experience, what trends have you observed in terms of payment challenges and cashflow management in the construction industry?"
     </li>
     <li>
      "As you provide business development and lead generation services for software companies in the UK market, would you be interested in exploring partnership opportunities to integrate payment acceleration solutions into your existing software offerings?"
     </li>
    </ol>

   </h2>
   <div class="content" name="handling_objection">
    <h3>
     Based on the context and putting myself in the seller's shoes, here are concise responses to overcome these objections:
    </h3>
    <h4>
     For Objection 1 - "We already have existing software/systems":
    </h4>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Emphasize that Copay integrates with existing systems (like COINS) rather than replacing them
     </li>
     <li>
      Highlight that it's a complementary solution focused specifically on payment acceleration and supply chain financial health
     </li>
     <li>
      Stress the "zero disruption" aspect - it's an add-on that enhances current processes rather than changing them
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
     For Objection 2 - "We're too small/Cost concerns":
    </h4>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Point out that the solution is flexible and scales with your business - you only use it when you need it ("accelerate cashflow if and when you need it")
     </li>
     <li>
      Share testimonials from similar-sized companies (like the £2M painting business mentioned in the context) who found value
     </li>
     <li>
      Emphasize that it's more cost-effective than traditional financing options like factoring, as mentioned by one customer testimonial
     </li>
     <li>
      Highlight that there's no commitment - it's a "pay as you go" model where you only pay when you choose to accelerate payments
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The key is to position Copay as a flexible, complementary tool rather than a replacement system, with proven benefits for companies of various sizes.
