    <h3>
     Based on the prospect's profile and the seller's business offering, here are the 5 most relevant qualification questions to ask Miller Homes:
    </h3>
    <ol>
     <li>
      "What is your current process for managing payments to your subcontractors across your 10 regional offices, and what challenges do you face with this system?"
      <ul>
       <li>
        This helps understand their current payment workflow and pain points
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      "With over 1,000 employees and multiple regional operations, what is the approximate annual value of payments you make to your supply chain/subcontractors?"
      <ul>
       <li>
        This helps assess the potential scale of the opportunity
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      "How do you currently manage supply chain financial health and what measures do you have in place to prevent supply chain disruptions due to cashflow issues?"
      <ul>
       <li>
        This aligns with their need to maintain reliable operations across multiple locations
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      "Are you currently using any early payment or dynamic discounting solutions with your suppliers? If so, what has been your experience?"

   <div class="content" name="handling_objection">
    <h3>
     Based on the context and putting myself in the seller's shoes, here are the most relevant counter-arguments for each objection:
    </h3>
    <h4>
     For Objection 1 - "We already have established payment processes - why change?"
    </h4>
    <ul>
     <li>
      This solution generates millions in cost savings through dynamic discounting while maintaining your existing processes
     </li>
     <li>
      It's fully integrated with existing systems (like COINS) for seamless implementation
     </li>
     <li>
      It's not about changing processes, but optimizing them to create a win-win situation with your supply chain
     </li>
     <li>
      You can improve supply chain resilience by reducing vendor financial distress without disrupting current operations
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
     For Objection 2 - "Our current cash position is strong - we don't need early payment solutions"
    </h4>
    <ul>
     <li>
      This isn't about needing financing - it's about generating zero-risk, high-yield returns on your existing cash
     </li>
     <li>
      Strong cash position actually means greater opportunity to earn significant returns through early payment discounts
     </li>
     <li>
      You can leverage your strong cash position to strengthen supplier relationships and reduce supply chain risks
     </li>
     <li>
      It's an opportunity to turn idle cash into profit while supporting your vendors' cash flow needs
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The key is to position this not as a financing solution but as a strategic tool to generate returns and strengthen the supply chain ecosystem.

     Based on the context about Copay being a financial/payment solution for construction companies, these techstack items are most relevant:

    <ul>
     <li>
      Salesforce

     <li>
      Stripe

     <li>
