    </h3>
    <p>
     Based on Keltbray being a large UK-based construction and engineering contractor with 1,433 employees and Copay offering construction payment acceleration services, here are the 5 most relevant qualification questions:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      <strong>
       What is your current payment cycle to subcontractors, and what challenges do you face in managing cashflow across your supply chain?
      </strong>
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Are you currently using any solutions to optimize your payment processes or generate savings through early payment discounts?
      </strong>
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       With operations across multiple UK locations, how do you currently manage payment consistency and visibility across different projects and regions?
      </strong>
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       What percentage of your subcontractors experience cashflow challenges that might impact project timelines or quality?
      </strong>
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       As a specialist engineering contractor offering various services, how important is supply chain resilience and reducing vendor churn due to financial distress for your business continuity?
      </strong>
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     These questions will help determine if Keltbray could benefit from Copay's dynamic discounting tool to generate cost savings while supporting their extensive supply chain across their UK operations.
