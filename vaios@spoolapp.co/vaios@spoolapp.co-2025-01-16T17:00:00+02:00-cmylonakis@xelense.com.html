     Based on the prospect's profile and the seller's business focus, here are the 5 most relevant qualification questions to ask:
    </h3>
    <ol>
     <li>
      <p>
       "What are your current growth objectives for expanding beyond Cyprus and Greece, and what challenges are you facing in entering new markets with your HR software solutions?"
      </p>
      <p>
       - This helps understand their expansion needs and if they align with the seller's market expansion services.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       "How are you currently acquiring new customers for PeopleHub, and what's your target customer acquisition cost?"
      </p>
      <p>
       - This reveals their current go-to-market approach and potential pain points in customer acquisition that the seller could address.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       "What's your current sales process for enterprise clients, and how satisfied are you with your conversion rates?"
      </p>
      <p>
       - This helps understand their sales efficiency and if they need help optimizing their B2B sales approach.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       "Are you currently using any AI tools for your customer acquisition efforts, and if so, how effective have they been?"
      </p>
      <p>
       - This assesses their current AI adoption and potential need for the seller's AI-powered solutions.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       "What's your timeline for scaling your customer base, and what resources have you allocated for go-to-market initiatives?"
      </p>
      <p>
       - This helps qualify their urgency and budget readiness for the seller's services.
      </p>
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     These questions focus on understanding their:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Market expansion needs
     </li>
     <li>
      Current customer acquisition challenges
     </li>
     <li>
      Sales process effectiveness
     </li>
     <li>
      AI tool adoption
     </li>
     <li>
      Growth timeline and resource availability
     </li>
    </ul>

    Objection Handling
    <span class="expand-indicator">
     +
    </span>
   </h2>
   <div class="content" name="handling_objection">
    <h3>
     Based on the context and putting myself in the seller's shoes, here's how I would handle these objections:
    </h3>
    <h4>
     1. Budget/Price concerns:
    </h4>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Emphasize ROI by highlighting how the solution helps systematically grow revenue and establish predictable growth engines
     </li>
     <li>
      Point out that the framework combines AI-powered tools with expert support, providing value beyond just software
     </li>
     <li>
      Stress cost efficiency - the solution helps companies achieve growth "in the most time &amp; cost efficient way"
     </li>
     <li>
      Position it as getting "experienced commercial co-founder" expertise at a fraction of the cost of hiring one
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
     2. Current solution works fine:
    </h4>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Highlight limitations of status quo: Most B2B companies rely on word-of-mouth/personal networks leading to "slow, unpredictable growth"
     </li>
     <li>
      Emphasize the scalability advantage: The solution provides a "repeatable and scalable sales engine" versus current manual processes
     </li>
     <li>
      Focus on competitive advantage: The framework helps "establish a foothold in competitive markets" which current tools may not address
     </li>
     <li>
      Stress the hands-on implementation support - unlike typical tools, they "roll up sleeves" to ensure successful adoption and results
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The key is focusing on value creation and competitive differentiation rather than just features, while acknowledging and addressing the real concerns about cost and change management.
