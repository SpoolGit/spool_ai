    <h3>
     Based on the context and L-Stone Capital's profile, here are the 5 most relevant qualification questions to ask the prospect:
    </h3>
    <ol>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Investment Focus &amp; Portfolio:
      </strong>
      "How many startups are currently in your portfolio, and what percentage of them are B2B software companies that might need help with customer acquisition and market expansion?"
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Growth Stage Support:
      </strong>
      "At what stage do you typically provide the most hands-on support to your portfolio companies in terms of go-to-market strategy and customer acquisition?"
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Geographic Expansion:
      </strong>
      "Are your portfolio companies primarily focused on expanding within Greece, or do they have plans to enter other European markets? What markets are of particular interest?"
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Current GTM Challenges:
      </strong>
      "What are the biggest go-to-market challenges your portfolio companies are currently facing when trying to acquire B2B customers?"
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Decision Making Process:
      </strong>
      "When it comes to engaging external go-to-market consultants for your portfolio companies, what's your typical evaluation and decision-making process?"
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     These questions help:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Understand the potential scale of opportunity (portfolio size and B2B focus)
     </li>
     <li>
      Identify specific needs around market expansion
     </li>
     <li>
      Gauge the VC's involvement in portfolio companies' growth
     </li>
     <li>
      Uncover pain points that the seller's services could address
     </li>
     <li>
      Understand how to navigate the sales process with the VC firm
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The questions are aligned with both L-Stone Capital's investment focus in technology startups and the seller's B2B go-to-market consulting services.

    Objection Handling
    <span class="expand-indicator">

    </span>
   </h2>
   <div class="content" name="handling_objection">
    <p>
     Based on the context and putting myself in the seller's shoes, here's how I would handle these objections:
    </p>
    <h4>
     1. Budget/Cost concerns for small VC firm:
    </h4>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Emphasize ROI and efficiency gains - highlight how the solution can help them do more with less people
     </li>
     <li>
      Offer a scaled-down version or flexible pricing model that aligns with their size
     </li>
     <li>
      Position it as an investment that will help them compete with larger firms despite their small team size
     </li>
     <li>
      Focus on cost savings from automation and improved productivity
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
     2. Lack of immediate need/priority:
    </h4>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Share specific examples of how similar small firms have transformed their processes and seen quick wins
     </li>
     <li>
      Focus on the competitive advantage angle - staying ahead of industry changes rather than falling behind
     </li>
     <li>
      Propose a small pilot or trial period to demonstrate immediate value with minimal disruption
     </li>
     <li>
      Highlight how AI and modern tools are transforming the industry (as mentioned in context) - create urgency around not getting left behind
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The key is to position the solution as a strategic investment that helps them compete above their weight class, rather than just another expense. Keep the initial commitment small to reduce risk while demonstrating clear value.
