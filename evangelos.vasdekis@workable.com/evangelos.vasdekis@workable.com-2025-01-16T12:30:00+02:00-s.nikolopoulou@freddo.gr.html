    <h3>
     Based on the context and my experience, here are effective responses to handle these common objections:
    </h3>
    <h4>
     For Objection 1 - "Too expensive for a small business":
    </h4>
    <p>
     1. Focus on ROI and cost savings:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      "I understand budget concerns. Let me show you how our solution can actually save you money by reducing time spent on manual processes and hiring costs."
     </li>
     <li>
      "While there is an investment, consider that improving your hiring efficiency could save significant costs in reduced turnover and better quality hires."
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     2. Highlight scalability and value:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      "Our solution is specifically designed to scale with small businesses like yours. You only pay for what you need now, and can expand as you grow."
     </li>
     <li>
      "For a business of your size with 27 employees, streamlining your HR processes now will set you up for more efficient growth."
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
     For Objection 2 - "Current manual system works fine":
    </h4>
    <p>
     1. Focus on efficiency gains:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      "While your current system may work, let me show you how automating these processes could save your team several hours per week that could be spent on more strategic tasks."
     </li>
     <li>
      "Many of our customers thought their manual systems were sufficient until they saw how much more efficiently they could operate with our solution."
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     2. Highlight risk mitigation:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      "Manual systems can leave you vulnerable to compliance issues and data loss. Our solution helps protect your business by ensuring proper documentation and secure data storage."
     </li>
     <li>
      "As your business grows, manual systems become increasingly difficult to maintain. Our platform helps you stay organized and compliant as you scale."
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The key is to focus on specific value propositions that address their business size and needs while demonstrating clear ROI and efficiency gains.
