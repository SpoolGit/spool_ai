    <h3>
     Based on the context and my experience, here are the most relevant arguments to overcome these objections:
    </h3>
    <h4>
     For Budget/Cost concerns:
    </h4>
    <ol>
     <li>
      Focus on ROI and cost savings:
      <ul>
       <li>
        Highlight how the platform can reduce time-to-hire and increase HR productivity by 30%
       </li>
       <li>
        Emphasize cost savings from consolidating multiple tools/systems into one platform
       </li>
       <li>
        Demonstrate potential savings from reducing agency fees and third-party tool costs (up to 100% according to data)
       </li>
       <li>
        Use the ATS ROI calculator to show specific cost benefits for their organization
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>
     For Current vendor/solution objections:
    </h4>
    <ol start="2">
     <li>
      Focus on ease of transition and superior functionality:
      <ul>
       <li>
        Highlight the comprehensive feature set including AI technology, automated scheduling, and mobile capabilities that may be missing from their current system
       </li>
       <li>
        Emphasize the hassle-free implementation with "quick and easy onboarding"
       </li>
       <li>
        Point to testimonials from similar consulting firms who have successfully switched
       </li>
       <li>
        Offer a free 15-day trial to demonstrate the platform's advantages over their current solution
       </li>
       <li>
        Highlight integration capabilities with existing HR systems
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     The key is to position Workable as an investment that delivers measurable ROI through increased efficiency and reduced costs, rather than just another expense. For the current vendor objection, focus on superior capabilities and ease of transition rather than directly criticizing their existing solution.
