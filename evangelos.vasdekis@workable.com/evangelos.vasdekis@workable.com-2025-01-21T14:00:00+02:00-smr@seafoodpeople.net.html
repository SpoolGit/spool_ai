    <h3>
     Based on the context and putting myself in the seller's shoes, here are the most relevant arguments to overcome these objections:
    </h3>
    <h4>
     For Cost/Budget concerns (49 employees):
    </h4>
    <ol>
     <li>
      Emphasize ROI through time savings and automation - highlight how Workable automates manual tasks like posting to 200+ job boards, scheduling interviews, and document management
     </li>
     <li>
      Offer the 15-day free trial with no credit card required to prove value before commitment
     </li>
     <li>
      Position it as a scalable solution that can grow with their company - they only pay for what they need now
     </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>
     For "Current system working fine":
    </h4>
    <ol>
     <li>
      Focus on efficiency gains - showcase features like AI-powered candidate screening, self-scheduling tools, and automated workflows that their current process likely lacks
     </li>
     <li>
      Highlight the all-in-one platform advantage - having recruiting, onboarding and HR management in one system vs. fragmented processes
     </li>
     <li>
      Emphasize how 27,000+ companies have improved their hiring process with Workable, including many consulting firms looking to streamline operations
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     The key is to position Workable not as a cost but as an investment that will make their current process more efficient while providing tools for future growth. Keep the focus on specific pain points their current system may have and how Workable's features directly address those challenges.
