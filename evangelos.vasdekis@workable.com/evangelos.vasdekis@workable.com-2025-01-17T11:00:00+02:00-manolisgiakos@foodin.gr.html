    <h3>
     Based on the context and the prospect's profile, here are the 5 most relevant qualification questions the seller should ask to determine if Foodin is a good fit for Workable's HR software:
    </h3>
    <ol>
     <li>
      "What is your current process for managing hiring and recruitment for your 18-person service technician team? How do you handle job postings, applications, and candidate tracking?"
     </li>
     <li>
      "With three service stations across Greece, how do you currently manage employee data, time tracking, and scheduling across multiple locations?"
     </li>
     <li>
      "What challenges are you facing with your current HR processes, particularly around hiring, onboarding, and managing technical staff in the food &amp; beverage equipment industry?"
     </li>
     <li>
      "Are you planning to grow your team in the near future? If so, what are your hiring goals and timeline?"
     </li>
     <li>
      "Who is currently responsible for HR functions in your company, and what tools/systems are they using to manage recruitment, employee data, and time tracking?"
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     These questions are strategically chosen because they:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Focus on understanding their current HR pain points
     </li>
     <li>
      Address their multi-location structure
     </li>
     <li>
      Explore their technical workforce management needs
     </li>
     <li>
      Assess growth plans that would require better HR tools
     </li>
     <li>
      Help identify decision makers and existing systems
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The questions align with Workable's all-in-one HR platform capabilities while addressing the specific context of a food &amp; beverage equipment service company with distributed technical staff.

    <h3>
     Based on the context and my experience, here's how I would handle these objections:
    </h3>
    <h4>
     For Cost/Price Objection (Small F&amp;B company):
    </h4>
    <p>
     Emphasize ROI by highlighting:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Cost savings from reduced agency fees (reference Alexander Dennis case saving $300k in first year)
     </li>
     <li>
      Time savings through automation and streamlined processes (reference Lethbridge reducing time-to-hire by 50%)
     </li>
     <li>
      The platform's ability to scale with their business growth
     </li>
     <li>
      Free 15-day trial to test the full platform without risk
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
     For Implementation/Integration Concerns:
    </h4>
    <p>
     Address fears by highlighting:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Mobile-friendly, intuitive interface ("very easy to use and intuitive" per customer testimonials)
     </li>
     <li>
      Built-in integration capabilities with common tools (calendar, email, video conferencing)
     </li>
     <li>
      Comprehensive help center and dedicated customer support
     </li>
     <li>
      Gradual implementation possible - can start with core features and expand usage
     </li>
     <li>
      No disruption to existing systems as it's a cloud-based solution that works alongside current processes
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The key is to position these as investments rather than costs, and emphasize the smooth transition process backed by support resources.
