    <h3>
     Based on the context and my expertise as a sales researcher, here's how I would handle these objections:
    </h3>
    <h4>
     1. For Budget constraints/cost concerns:
    </h4>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Emphasize ROI by highlighting how automation reduces administrative time and costs
     </li>
     <li>
      Point out that manual processes have hidden costs (staff time, errors, missed candidates)
     </li>
     <li>
      Reference the quote from Anna-Katje Spark about how the platform provides clearer reporting and a "single source of truth" that even board members prefer
     </li>
     <li>
      Offer the 15-day free trial to prove value before commitment
     </li>
     <li>
      Focus on the scalability - "buy what you need and workable can grow with you"
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
     2. For "Current manual processes are good enough":
    </h4>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Highlight specific pain points that automation solves (getting approvals, creating reports, managing compliance)
     </li>
     <li>
      Emphasize ease of transition with features like automated resume parsing and approval workflows
     </li>
     <li>
      Point out competitive disadvantage of staying manual while competitors modernize
     </li>
     <li>
      Focus on employee experience benefits - self-scheduling interviews, mobile access, automated notifications
     </li>
     <li>
      Stress that resistance to change could mean missing out on top talent due to slower hiring processes
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The key is to position the solution as an investment in efficiency and growth rather than just an expense, while making the transition seem manageable and worthwhile.
