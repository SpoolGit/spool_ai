    <h3>
     Based on the company description and the seller's HR software business, here are the 5 most relevant qualification questions to ask Meisterwerk:
    </h3>
    <ol>
     <li>
      "How do you currently manage your HR processes and employee data for your 34 employees? What challenges are you facing with your current system?"
      <ul>
       <li>
        This helps understand their current HR pain points and needs
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      "With your recent €6M Series A funding and plans to expand across Europe, what are your hiring plans for the next 12-18 months?"
      <ul>
       <li>
        This assesses their potential growth and hiring needs which would require robust HR software
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      "How do you currently handle recruitment, onboarding, and employee documentation across your DACH operations? Are you looking to standardize these processes?"
      <ul>
       <li>
        This explores their multi-country HR management needs and process standardization requirements
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      "What are your key requirements around time tracking and payroll reporting for your team members across different locations?"
      <ul>
       <li>
        This addresses their needs around core HR functions like time/attendance and payroll, which the seller's platform offers
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      "How important is having an integrated HR system that can handle both recruiting and employee management as you scale from 34 to potentially 100+ employees?"
      <ul>
       <li>
        This helps qualify their need for an all-in-one HR platform vs. point solutions as they grow
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     These questions focus on understanding their:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Current HR challenges
     </li>
     <li>
      Growth plans and future needs

    <h3>
     Based on the context and my experience, here's how I would handle these objections:
    </h3>
    <h4>
     1. Price/Cost Objection:
    </h4>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Emphasize ROI by highlighting that Workable is an all-in-one platform combining recruiting, onboarding, and HR management, eliminating costs of multiple systems
     </li>
     <li>
      Point out how automation features (AI screening, automated sourcing, self-scheduled interviews) save significant time and resources
     </li>
     <li>
      Mention the flexible pricing model that allows companies to "buy what you need and workable can grow with you"
     </li>
     <li>
      Reference that over 30,000 companies have successfully used the platform, validating the value proposition
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
     2. Current Solution/Status Quo Objection:
    </h4>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Focus on seamless integration capabilities with existing tools (calendar, email, video conferencing, etc.)
     </li>
     <li>
      Highlight the comprehensive API access and developer tools that enable custom integration with current systems
     </li>
     <li>
      Emphasize the platform's ability to import existing data and processes through data export/import capabilities
     </li>
     <li>
      Point out advanced features that might be missing in their current solution (AI technology, 400M+ candidate profiles, automated workflows)
     </li>
     <li>
      Stress the platform's scalability to support company growth without needing to switch systems again later
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The key is to position Workable not as a cost but as an investment that streamlines operations and provides long-term value through comprehensive functionality and integration capabilities.
