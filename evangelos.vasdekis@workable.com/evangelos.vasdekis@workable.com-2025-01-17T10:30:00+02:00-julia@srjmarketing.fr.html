    <h3>
     Based on the context and putting myself in the seller's shoes, here are the most effective arguments to overcome these objections:
    </h3>
    <h4>
     For Cost/Budget concerns:
    </h4>
    <ol>
     <li>
      Highlight ROI through automation: "Our platform automates manual tasks and reduces time-to-hire by 50%, which translates directly to cost savings. One customer saved over $300K in agency fees in their first year."
     </li>
     <li>
      Offer flexible trial: "We offer a 15-day free trial with no credit card required, so you can experience the value firsthand without any risk."
     </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>
     For "Current process works fine":
    </h4>
    <ol>
     <li>
      Focus on scalability: "While manual processes may work now, our platform helps you scale efficiently as you grow. You'll have everything centralized and automated, eliminating the administrative burden that comes with growth."
     </li>
     <li>
      Emphasize competitive advantage: "In today's competitive market, speed matters. Our platform helps you move quickly on good candidates before competitors do, with features like automated workflows and self-scheduled interviews."
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     The key is to position the software not as an expense, but as an investment that delivers clear ROI through time savings, reduced costs, and improved hiring outcomes. Keep the focus on their business goals rather than just the technology.
