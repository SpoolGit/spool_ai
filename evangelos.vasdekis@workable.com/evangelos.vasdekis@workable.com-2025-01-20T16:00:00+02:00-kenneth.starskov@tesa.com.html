    Objection Handling

     +
    </span>
   </h2>
   <div class="content" name="handling_objection">
    <h3>
     Based on the context and the objections, here's how I would handle them:
    </h3>
    <h4>
     For Price/Cost Objection:
    </h4>
    <ol>
     <li>
      Emphasize ROI and cost-saving features:
      <ul>
       <li>
        Highlight automation capabilities that reduce manual work and administrative overhead
       </li>
       <li>
        Showcase how the system consolidates multiple HR functions (recruiting, onboarding, employee management) into one platform, eliminating need for multiple systems
       </li>
       <li>
        Stress the scalability - "buy what you need and workable can grow with you"
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>
     2. Integration Complexity Objection:
    </h4>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Point out the 270+ pre-built integrations with common HR/payroll systems
     </li>
     <li>
      Emphasize rapid system setup capabilities - "get your teams operational within days"
     </li>
     <li>
      Highlight dedicated implementation support and account management for enterprise clients
     </li>
     <li>
      Stress multi-language, multi-currency, and multi-location support built into the platform
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
     Additional selling points I would add:
    </h4>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Offer a 15-day free trial to prove value before commitment
     </li>
     <li>
      Emphasize the platform's proven track record (27,000+ companies across 100+ countries)
     </li>
     <li>
      Highlight security certifications (ISO 27001, SOC 2) which are crucial for a chemical manufacturer
     </li>
     <li>
      Stress compliance features for managing global operations (GDPR, EEO, CCPA)
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The key is focusing on how the system can reduce long-term costs through automation while making the implementation process as smooth as possible with dedicated support.
