    <h3>
     Since the provided context doesn't directly address how to handle these specific objections, I'll provide strategic responses based on my expertise as a sales researcher:
    </h3>
    <h4>
     For Price/Cost Objection:
    </h4>
    <ol>
     <li>
      Focus on ROI and efficiency gains:
      <ul>
       <li>
        Highlight how the technology will save time in managing Hajj/Umrah bookings and customer data
       </li>
       <li>
        Emphasize cost savings from reduced manual work and paperwork
       </li>
       <li>
        Calculate potential revenue increase from being able to handle more bookings efficiently
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      Discuss flexible payment options:
      <ul>
       <li>
        Offer monthly payment plans rather than large upfront costs
       </li>
       <li>
        Start with basic package and ability to scale up as needed
       </li>
       <li>
        Highlight that cost scales with business growth
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>
     For "Current Process Works Fine" Objection:
    </h4>
    <ol>
     <li>
      Focus on growth limitations of current system:
      <ul>
       <li>
        Discuss how manual processes limit ability to scale operations
       </li>
       <li>
        Point out risks of relying on paper records/basic tools (data loss, errors)
       </li>
       <li>
        Show how competitors are modernizing and gaining advantages
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      Emphasize enhanced customer experience:
      <ul>
       <li>
        Highlight how technology improves communication with pilgrims
       </li>
       <li>
        Demonstrate faster booking confirmations and updates
       </li>
       <li>
        Show how better organization leads to smoother pilgrim experiences
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     The key is to position the solution as an investment in growth and modernization rather than just an expense, while acknowledging the religious and traditional nature of their business.
