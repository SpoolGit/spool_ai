    <h3>
     Based on the prospect's profile and the seller's HR software business, here are the 5 most relevant qualification questions to ask:
    </h3>
    <ol>
     <li>
      What is your current recruitment and HR management process, particularly for managing your 1,500+ employees across multiple locations (San Francisco and India)?
     </li>
     <li>
      How are you currently handling applicant tracking, onboarding, and employee data management for your healthcare technology organization? What challenges are you facing?
     </li>
     <li>
      What tools or systems do you use to manage time tracking and attendance across different time zones and locations?
     </li>
     <li>
      How do you currently manage performance reviews and employee documentation for your global workforce? What improvements would you like to see?
     </li>
     <li>
      What are your key priorities in terms of HR automation and efficiency, especially given your company's rapid growth in the healthcare technology sector?
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     These questions are strategically chosen because they:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Address the prospect's specific context (healthcare tech, multi-location)
     </li>
     <li>
      Focus on potential pain points (managing large workforce across locations)
     </li>
     <li>
      Explore current processes to identify gaps
     </li>
     <li>
      Help understand their HR automation needs
     </li>
     <li>
      Allow for discussion of the seller's HR software solutions that could address their challenges
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The questions align with the seller's HR software capabilities while being relevant to the prospect's specific situation and potential needs.

    <h3>
     Since the provided context doesn't directly address how to handle these specific healthcare technology objections, I'll provide recommendations for how to handle them as a seller:
    </h3>
    <h4>
     For Cost/ROI Objection:
    </h4>
    <p>
     1. Emphasize measurable ROI metrics:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Quantify time savings in hiring/onboarding processes
     </li>
     <li>
      Highlight reduction in manual work and administrative costs
     </li>
     <li>
      Show how automation reduces errors and compliance risks
     </li>
     <li>
      Present case studies from similar healthcare companies demonstrating ROI
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
     For Integration Complexity Objection:
    </h4>
    <p>
     1. Address technical concerns directly:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Emphasize API capabilities and existing healthcare integrations
     </li>
     <li>
      Highlight dedicated implementation support team
     </li>
     <li>
      Discuss phased rollout approach to minimize disruption
     </li>
     <li>
      Reference successful integrations with major healthcare systems
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
     Key is to:
    </h4>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Back claims with specific numbers/examples
     </li>
     <li>
      Show understanding of healthcare compliance needs
     </li>
     <li>
      Demonstrate proven track record in their industry
     </li>
     <li>
      Offer to connect them with similar reference customers
     </li>
     <li>
      Present a clear implementation plan that minimizes risks
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The goal is to shift the conversation from cost/complexity concerns to business value and proven solutions.
