     Here are the most relevant arguments the seller can use to overcome the objections:
    </p>
    <h3>
     Cost Concerns
    </h3>
    <ol>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Value for Money
      </strong>
      : Highlight the competitive pricing and the quality of service provided, ensuring customers get the best value for their money.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Special Offers
      </strong>
      : Mention any ongoing promotions, discounts, or flexible payment options to make the cost more manageable.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Long-Term Savings
      </strong>
      : Emphasize how the service can save money in the long run (e.g., 24/7 support, low-cost operations, and efficient fleet management).
     </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
     Lack of Trust in the Brand
    </h3>
    <ol>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Global Presence
      </strong>
      : Point out the brand’s extensive network and presence in multiple countries, showcasing its reliability and reputation.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Customer Support
      </strong>
      : Highlight the 24/7 customer service and support, ensuring customers feel secure and assisted at all times.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Testimonials and Awards
      </strong>
      : Share positive customer reviews, testimonials, or industry awards to build credibility and trust.
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     If the context doesn’t provide enough information, these arguments are still effective for addressing the objections.
