     Based on the provided context, here are the
     <strong>
      5 most relevant and important questions
     </strong>
     the seller (Surprice Car Rentals) should ask the prospect (an authorized BMW retailer) to determine if they are a good fit for the B2B offering, which includes franchise opportunities and partnerships with existing car rental companies:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      <strong>
       What is your current business model, and how do you see a partnership with Surprice Car Rentals enhancing your operations?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      - This helps understand the prospect's current operations and how they align with Surprice's offerings.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Do you have experience in the car rental industry, and if so, what has been your focus (e.g., luxury vehicles, fleet management, customer service)?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      - This assesses the prospect's expertise and whether it aligns with Surprice's franchise and partnership requirements.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       What are your goals for expanding or improving your car rental services, and how do you envision leveraging Surprice's global sales network and IT infrastructure?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      - This identifies the prospect's growth objectives and their interest in Surprice's support systems.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Are you open to adopting Surprice's brand, operational standards, and training programs to ensure consistency and quality across your services?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      - This evaluates the prospect's willingness to align with Surprice's brand and operational framework.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       What is your target market, and how do you plan to integrate Surprice's competitive rates and online booking facilities into your existing customer base?
      </strong>
      <br/>
      - This helps determine if the prospect's market aligns with Surprice's B2B solutions and if they can effectively utilize Surprice's tools.
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     These questions are designed to assess the prospect's fit with Surprice Car Rentals' franchise and partnership model, ensuring alignment in goals, operations, and market focus.
