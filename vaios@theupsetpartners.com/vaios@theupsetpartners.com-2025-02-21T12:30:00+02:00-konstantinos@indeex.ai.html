    <h3>
     Based on the context and putting myself in the seller's shoes, here's how I would handle these objections:
    </h3>
    <ol>
     <li>
      <h4>
       Budget/Cost concerns for small companies:
      </h4>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Focus on ROI and quick time-to-value: Demonstrate how the solution can help them save money or increase efficiency in the short term
       </li>
       <li>
        Offer flexible payment terms or a scaled-down version for smaller companies
       </li>
       <li>
        Highlight how the technology investment can help them compete with larger companies and grow their business
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      <h4>
       Integration complexity/Technical feasibility:
      </h4>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Propose a phased implementation approach to reduce risk and complexity
       </li>
       <li>
        Offer a proof of concept or pilot program to demonstrate integration capabilities
       </li>
       <li>
        Emphasize existing successful integrations with similar systems
       </li>
       <li>
        Provide dedicated technical support during the integration process
       </li>
       <li>
        Share case studies of successful implementations with similar-sized companies
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     The key is to address their specific pain points while demonstrating clear value and reducing perceived risk. Keep the focus on how your solution can help them achieve their business goals rather than just the technical aspects.

     Based on the context provided about The Upset Partners (which appears to be a B2B sales/growth consulting company), these techstack items are most relevant:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Google Tag Manager
     </li>
     <li>
      Google Analytics
     </li>
     <li>
      Facebook Custom Audiences

    </ul>
    <p>
     These are relevant because they relate to marketing, analytics and customer targeting which align with the company's focus on B2B sales and growth services.
