    <h3>
     Based on the context and putting myself in the seller's shoes, here are the most effective responses to those objections:
    </h3>
    <h4>
     For Cost/Budget Constraints:
    </h4>
    <ol>
     <li>
      Emphasize ROI and efficiency gains: "While you have existing HR tools, Workable automates many manual tasks from requisition to offer letter, which saves significant staff time and reduces administrative costs."
     </li>
     <li>
      Highlight consolidation benefits: "Rather than paying for multiple separate tools, Workable provides an all-in-one platform that can replace several of your current systems, potentially reducing overall software costs."
     </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>
     For Implementation/Integration Concerns:
    </h4>
    <ol>
     <li>
      Stress seamless integration capabilities: "Workable has built-in integrations with major calendar systems (Gmail/365), video platforms (Zoom/Teams/Meet), and payment systems, making the transition smooth while maintaining your existing workflows."
     </li>
     <li>
      Emphasize support and trial period: "We offer a 15-day free trial with full features and no credit card required, allowing you to test the platform's compatibility with your systems before making any commitment. Our team will support you throughout the implementation process."
     </li>
    </ol>

     These responses address the core concerns while highlighting the platform's value proposition and risk mitigation features.
