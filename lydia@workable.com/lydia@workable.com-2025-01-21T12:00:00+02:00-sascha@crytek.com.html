    <h3>
     Based on the prospect's profile (Crytek) and Workable's HR software offering, here are the 5 most relevant qualification questions to ask:
    </h3>
    <ol>
     <li>
      "With 550 employees across multiple international locations (Frankfurt, Kiev, Istanbul), how are you currently managing your recruitment and HR processes across these different offices?"
     </li>
     <li>
      "What challenges are you facing in your current hiring process, particularly for specialized gaming/technical roles like game developers, engine programmers, and 3D artists?"
     </li>
     <li>
      "How do you currently handle employee onboarding and management across your different international studios, and what tools are you using for this?"
     </li>
     <li>
      "Given your company's growth and presence in multiple countries, how do you ensure consistent HR processes and compliance across different regions?"
     </li>
     <li>
      "What are your current time-to-hire metrics, and how satisfied are you with your ability to find and attract top gaming industry talent through your current recruitment methods?"
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     These questions are strategically chosen because they:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Address the complexity of managing HR across multiple international locations
     </li>
     <li>
      Focus on industry-specific recruitment challenges
     </li>
     <li>
      Explore current processes and pain points
     </li>
     <li>
      Assess the need for standardized HR operations
     </li>
     <li>
      Help understand their recruitment efficiency metrics
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The questions align with Workable's all-in-one HR platform capabilities while addressing the specific needs of a large, international gaming company.

    Objection Handling

   </h2>
   <div class="content" name="handling_objection">
    <h3>
     Based on the context and my expertise as a sales researcher, here's how I would handle these objections for Crytek:
    </h3>
    <h4>
     For Objection 1: "We already have an existing recruitment system/process in place"
    </h4>
    <p>
     Key arguments:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Highlight Workable's comprehensive integration capabilities (200+ job boards, LinkedIn, etc.) that can enhance rather than replace their existing process
     </li>
     <li>
      Emphasize AI-powered features that can accelerate hiring while maintaining their current workflows
     </li>
     <li>
      Focus on how Workable can solve specific pain points in their current process (e.g., automated screening, collaborative hiring tools)
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
     For Objection 2: "The cost is too high for our current hiring needs"
    </h4>
    <p>
     Key arguments:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Demonstrate ROI by highlighting time savings through automation of administrative tasks (approvals, reporting, compliance)
     </li>
     <li>
      Emphasize scalability - the platform grows with them and pricing adjusts based on company size/needs
     </li>
     <li>
      Point out cost savings from consolidated tools (no need for separate systems for job posting, candidate screening, onboarding etc.)
     </li>
     <li>
      Highlight the 15-day free trial that allows them to validate the value before committing
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The key is to position Workable as an investment in efficiency and growth rather than just another cost, while demonstrating clear value aligned with Crytek's specific recruitment challenges as a mid-sized game development company.
