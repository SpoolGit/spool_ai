   <div class="content" name="handling_objection">
    <h3>
     Since the provided context doesn't directly address how to handle these specific sales objections, I'll provide practical responses for both objections:
    </h3>
    <h4>
     For Objection 1 - "Your solution is too expensive for a company our size":
    </h4>
    <p>
     Focus on ROI and value rather than cost:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      "I understand your concern about the investment. Let's look at how much you're currently spending on your existing systems and the cost of potential security breaches for a company your size"
     </li>
     <li>
      "Our solution can actually help reduce costs by consolidating multiple tools and improving efficiency"
     </li>
     <li>
      "For companies your size, we typically see an ROI within X months through [specific benefits]"
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
     For Objection 2 - "We already have cybersecurity tools and HR systems in place":
    </h4>
    <p>
     Acknowledge and differentiate:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      "That's great that you're already prioritizing security. What specific challenges are you facing with your current solutions?"
     </li>
     <li>
      "While you have existing tools, our solution offers unique features like [specific differentiators] that complement and enhance your current setup"
     </li>
     <li>
      "Many of our clients initially had other solutions but switched to us because we offer [unique value proposition] that helped them [specific benefit]"
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The key is to focus on value and differentiation rather than directly competing on price or features alone.
