    <h3>
     Based on the context and putting myself in the seller's shoes, here are the most relevant arguments to overcome these objections:
    </h3>
    <h4>
     For Budget/Cost concerns:
    </h4>
    <ol>
     <li>
      Highlight the ROI through automation - Workable automates many manual tasks like approvals, compliance, and reporting, saving significant time and resources for a small team
     </li>
     <li>
      Offer flexible pricing with a 15-day free trial to test the platform without commitment
     </li>
     <li>
      Emphasize how it combines multiple tools (ATS, sourcing, onboarding) into one platform, potentially replacing other standalone solutions they're paying for
     </li>
     <li>
      Point out that as a SaaS company themselves, they understand the importance of efficient hiring to scale their business
     </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>
     For Integration/Implementation concerns:
    </h4>
    <ol>
     <li>
      Stress the rapid system setup - teams can be operational within days, not months
     </li>
     <li>
      Highlight the 70+ integration partners and API access for custom integrations with their existing tech stack
     </li>
     <li>
      Mention the dedicated implementation support from product specialists to ensure smooth transition
     </li>
     <li>
      Emphasize the intuitive interface designed for easy adoption with minimal training needed
     </li>
     <li>
      Point to the comprehensive self-service learning resources and responsive support team available when needed
     </li>
    </ol>

     The key is focusing on how these potential challenges are specifically addressed in the platform's design and support structure.
