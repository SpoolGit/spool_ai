   <div class="content" name="handling_objection">
    <h3>
     Based on the context and taking the role of a seller, here's how I would handle these objections:
    </h3>
    <h4>
     1. Budget/Cost concerns:
    </h4>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Emphasize ROI by highlighting how the solution streamlines hiring processes, saving valuable time and resources
     </li>
     <li>
      Point out that as a software company, efficient hiring is crucial for their growth and competitiveness
     </li>
     <li>
      Mention that the pricing is scalable and can grow with their company
     </li>
     <li>
      Highlight that there's no upfront investment required (free trial available) to test the value
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
     2. Integration/Technical compatibility concerns:
    </h4>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Reference the robust API capabilities and multiple integration options (native integrations, 3rd party integrations)
     </li>
     <li>
      Highlight existing integrations with popular tools like LinkedIn, Gmail/365, Zoom/Teams/Meet
     </li>
     <li>
      Emphasize technical support during implementation (dedicated technical support during build phase)
     </li>
     <li>
      Point to the developer hub and documentation available for smooth integration
     </li>
     <li>
      Share that over 30,000 companies have successfully integrated the solution
     </li>
     <li>
      Mention the flexible integration builds available through unified API providers, iPaaS, Zapier, etc.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The key is to position these potential concerns as solved problems with proven solutions, backed by a strong track record of supporting similar-sized software companies.
