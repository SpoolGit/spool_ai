    <h3>
     Since the provided context doesn't directly address handling these specific sales objections, I'll provide recommendations for how to handle these objections as a seller:

        Quantify potential time savings and productivity gains
       </li>
       <li>
        Emphasize that it's an investment that will pay for itself through better operations
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      Offer flexible payment options:
      <ul>
       <li>
        Suggest monthly payment plans instead of large upfront costs
       </li>
       <li>
        Consider offering a startup/small business discount
       </li>
       <li>
        Propose a tiered pricing model that can scale with their growth
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>
     For Integration/Technical compatibility concerns:

    <ol>
     <li>
      Address technical feasibility:
      <ul>
       <li>
        Highlight existing API capabilities and integration options
       </li>
       <li>
        Share success stories of similar implementations with other fintech companies
       </li>
       <li>
        Offer a technical consultation to review their specific systems
       </li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>
      Reduce perceived risk:
      <ul>
       <li>
        Propose a pilot program or trial period
       </li>
       <li>
        Offer dedicated technical support during implementation

        Provide documentation of security standards and compliance certifications
